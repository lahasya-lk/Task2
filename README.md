Project Overview

This project simulates multiple students submitting their exam scores concurrently using Java threads.
Each thread writes student data — name, roll number, and marks — to a shared CSV file.
The writing process is made thread-safe using synchronization, ensuring that no data corruption occurs even when multiple threads write simultaneously.
This project also includes JUnit test cases to validate:
1)File writing correctness
2)Thread completion behavior

Features
Multiple threads simulating student score submissions
Thread-safe file operations using synchronized methods
Writes data to scores.csv in comma-separated format
Automated JUnit testing for:
File creation and content check
Thread completion verification
